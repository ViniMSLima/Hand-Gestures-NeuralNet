A Neural Net made in Python using Keras and trained to identify numbers from a dataset of hand gestures.

Transform.py takes images from the dataset and applies Fourier Transform (folder ds1), Image Binarization (folder ds2), or both (folder ds3).
These methods are applied to simplify the neural network and accelerate number recognition.
